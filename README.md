# Java Backend Journey 🚀

This repository tracks my **6-month journey** to become job-ready in **Java, DSA, and backend development**.  
I’m following a structured roadmap — mastering **core Java, Data Structures & Algorithms**, and moving toward **Spring Boot, Git, SQL, AWS, and DevOps**.  

Every folder represents a **topic milestone**, with clean code, comments, and daily commits.

## 🚀 Projects (Day 9 — OOP Practice)

### 🏦 Banking System
- Create bank accounts  
- Deposit/withdraw money  
- Manage balances  

### 📚 Library Management
- Add books  
- Issue/return books  
- Track members  

### 🎓 Student Data System
- Manage student information  
- Use classes & objects for structure  

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (Day 10+)

- Refactor projects into **multi-class OOP design** (e.g., `BankAccount`, `Library`, `Book`, etc.)  
- Add **JUnit tests** for project methods (`deposit()`, `withdraw()`, `issueBook()`, etc.)  
- Move into **Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists** for stronger DSA foundation

## 📅 Commitment

I study **6 hours/day** and commit daily progress to GitHub.  
This is not casual learning — it’s a disciplined roadmap to land a backend development role.
